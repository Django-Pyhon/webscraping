# webscraping
This is a sample that shows I can make web scraping.

This code block firsly ask you a web link from Mackolik.com
This site is contains match results.
With WebDriver from selenium library, opens the site.
Then it's starting to read some values which is affects the result of match.
Between the code blocks it's isolating the numeric metrics from strings.
In the end of lines, it's writing metrics to a CSV file, and close the Chrome.
